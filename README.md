# Hotspots - Drag-and-drop interactive drawings in FoundryVTT

Hotspots is a [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) module which allows you to attach journal entries, scenes, macros, and more to drawings in your scene.

This drag-and-drop interface provides support for new levels of map interaction that are useful for landing pages and battlemaps alike.
