- If macros will live unloaded in compendia, consider whether to add caching & cache-invalidation
- Confirm we don't need compendia as a requirement, and if not, nuke it
- Check if a player can run a GM's macro by id - this may be why we need a compendium
- Probably nuke the packaged compendium either way
- Should there be a "do this as user vs do this as GM" button?
  - Probably - of note: individual user macros are accessible to everyone
- We can detect a change in token target, but not necessarily a click event. If we _do_ need "run this as GM" support, which we likely do if we want parity with e.g. multilevel tokens, then we need a message system for the DM. Abuse the chat? Whisper, but keep the record hidden somehow
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Jest
- Save actual macros - should work with a single field "id" or "package.pack.id"
- point-in-polygon algorithm
- Use a bundler - modules are a performance concern
